----We can	Install bookstack by the following methods.
		a)Manual Installation
		b)Using Shellscript for various Ubuntu versions.
		c)Using DOcker Containers.
		d)Community Guides for different linux distributions.
						
						A)Manual Installation:  ->Ensure the above requirements are met before installing.

												->This project currently uses the release branch of the BookStack GitHub repository as a stable channel for providing updates. 
												
												->The installation is currently somewhat complicated and will be made simpler in future releases. Some PHP or Laravel experience will make this easier.
												
												->The following are the manual installation steps:
												
    												1.Clone the release branch of the BookStack GitHub repository into a folder.

													   -> git clone https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack.git --branch release --single-branch

    												2.cd into the application folder and run composer install --no-dev.
    												
													3.Copy the .env.example file to .env and fill with your own database and mail details.
													
													4.Ensure the storage, bootstrap/cache & public/uploads folders are writable by the web server.
													
													5.In the application root, Run php artisan key:generate to generate a unique application key.
													
													6.If not using Apache or if .htaccess files are disabled you will have to create some URL rewrite rules as shown below.
													
													7.Set the web root on your server to point to the BookStack public folder. This is done with the root setting on Nginx or the DocumentRoot setting on Apache.
													
													8.Run php artisan migrate to update the database.
													
													9.You can now login using the default admin details admin@admin.com with a password of password. You should change these details immediately after logging in for the first time.
						
												 -> Webserver Configuration:: we need to configure the webserver for manual installation by following steps
												 							
																a)Apache VirtualHost Example Configuration: ->This configuration is only for http not for https
																											-> For HTTPS we recommend using https://certbot.eff.org/
																											
																											-> cd into the /etc/apache2/sites-available and then vi bookstack.conf file.
																											
																											-> Edit the ServerName with your domain name or ip address,then save and exit.
																b) Nginx Server block example configuration: Here also you need to add the server name with your domain name or ip in the particular configuration file.
						
						B)Using Shellscript: 1)Ubuntu 22.04 Installation Script with http:
													
															->Before, we need to register domain or ip in the DNS A record or use localhost.
															->This is only for a fresh OS and here i use localhost to host bookstack instance.
															->The script will install the requirements automatically which are mentioned above like Apache, MySQL 8.0 & PHP-8.1.
															->It could Overwrite any existing web setup on the machine.
															->It also does not set up mail settings or configure system security so you will have to do those separately. 
															->You can use the script as a reference if you’re installing on a non-fresh machine.
															-> Here we have following commands to download the script and further.
																
																a) To download the script.
																    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BookStackApp/devops/main/scripts/installation-ubuntu-22.04.sh
																
																b) Make it executable.
																	chmod a+x installation-ubuntu-22.04.sh
																
																c) Run the script with admin permissions.
																	sudo ./installation-ubuntu-22.04.sh
																
																d)After that, asking to provide IP or Domain or localhost to host the bookstack
																
																e)Then it is installing using the domain or ip or localhost going through the nine(9) steps process.
																
																f)By default it is configuring the apache server.
																
																g)Setup finshed and you will get login email, login password, install path, Install script log and Access URL.
																
																h)You can copy and paste the access URL in the browser and you will get a login page.
																
																i)you can login with the default credentials and change after in the edit profile for security.
